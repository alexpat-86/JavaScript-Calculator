tried to make a calculator using only my knowledge, works great but only accepts two calculations at a time.

I'm still learning and wanted to try and make a calculator without searching anything and using only what I had learned. It took about three days but everything works as it should which is a relief.

I realise the method I've used is probably the most convoluted possible and I'm open to anyone who wants to explain easier methods etc.

it comes with the four main operators, plus times minus and divide. It also has a clear function for clearing the calculator and decimal function for decimal points obviously.

If anyone could look through my code and explain how I could make it able to accept more than two calculations that would be great. You can do 22+5673 but not 22+5673*4 for example

Thanks
